# AND101 Project 1 - Hello, Squirrel!

Submitted by: **Dosbol Aliev**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Summary

**SquirrelApp** is an android app that recreates the common "Hello, World!", to introduce ourselves to the neighborhood squirrel üêø.  **üêø. Designed to showcase your personality, hobbies, and coding skills, this app is a fun way to practice Android development basics like layouts, themes, and resource management.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üêøüì±‚ú®**

## Notes
This app was my introduction to Android development using Kotlin and XML. I learned how to:

- Structure a UI using ConstraintLayout

- Use resources like strings.xml, colors.xml, and dimens.xml to manage app content and styling

- Reference drawable assets (like a profile photo) correctly in XML

- Customize themes and styles using themes.xml

- Debug layout and resource linking issues in Android Studio

It also helped reinforce key concepts in mobile development, such as separating logic from design, managing images, and using TextView and ImageView elements effectively.

I'm excited to keep building on these skills in future Android projects!
